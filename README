Serverboy Cloud
Version 0.3

Cloud is a simple DB abstraction layer that makes it really easy to create
awesome data-driven PHP apps in the least amount of time.


How to use:

Cloud is not dissimilar in nature to an ORM, in so far as it allows the you to
interact directly with records in the database as if they were objects. Unlike
an ORM, however, records are amorphous: they do not have a model to adhere to.
Rather than follow a model, the records are stored in what are called "tokens."
